                        Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript?



                i)OBJECT WITH UNASSIGNED PROPERTIES:

               var myCar = new Object();
                   myCar.make = 'Ford';
                   myCar.model = 'Mustang';
                   myCar.year = 1969;

  OUTPUT:
      Unassigned properties of an object are undefined (and not null).
       myCar.color; // undefined

               ii)Objects are sometimes called associative arrays, since each property is associated with a string value that can be used to access it.
           
               iii) A CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION :
                 
                  *Using a constructor function
                      -Alternatively, you can create an object with these two steps:
                      -Define the object type by writing a constructor function. There is a strong convention, with good reason, to use a capital initial letter.
                      -Create an instance of the object with new.

  FOR EXAMPLE : 
     
                   class Polygon {
                        constructor() {
                              this.name = 'Polygon';
               }
               }

                  const poly1 = new Polygon();

                       console.log(poly1.name);

         OUTPUT:
         
                   Polygon.



            iv)  OBJECT.CREATE METHOD:


                * Object.create() method 
                   -it allows you to choose the prototype object for the object you want to create, without having to define a constructor function.
